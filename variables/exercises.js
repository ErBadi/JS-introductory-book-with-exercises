// Ex 5

Here, since we are declaring a variable again, not reassigning its value
it returns the value of the globally scoped one

// Ex 6

const FOO = 'bar';

console.log(FOO);

/*
Here it doesnÂ´t throw an error since the variable is not being reassigned
but instead is being declared again within the block, son they don't
interfere between them. This is tricky xD.
